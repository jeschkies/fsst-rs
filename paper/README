dbtext/         a new compression test corpus, consisting of various textual database columns

===========	various tools and scripts for the replication of the results in the paper
===========	will run only on Linux really, and needs CPU counters
cw.cpp 
vcw.cpp
hcw.cpp:        earlier versions of FSST

filtertest.cpp: test program for LZ4 vs FSST that mimicks a table scan with a pusehd down filter
linetest.cpp:   test program for LZ4 that tests fine-grained line-at-a-time LZ4 compression

results/        place where the final results and figures can be found

compare.sh  
		postprocessing to get Table1 from the paper

evolution.sh  
		comparison of various FSST versions (above) 

kernels.sh  
		comparison of various FSST encoding kernels 

lz4-smallblocks.sh
		scripts that tests compression factor achieved by LZ4 on various blocksizes
 		(make sure you have lz4 --version 1.8.1 ahead in PATH)

sorted.sh
		comparison FSST vs LZ4 in compression factors when dbtext files are sorted
